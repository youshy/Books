# Books

What have I read. Started in 2020. 

This list doesn't contain all the books I have, it contains all the books I've read from 12/02/2020 (I could've made the repo sooner but, the worst case scenario is, that I will read a lot of books I have again. And I can live with that!)

## 2020

[X] Cliff Stoll - The Cuckoo's Egg

[X] Chuck Palahniuk - Fight Club

[ ] John Dickie - Cosa Nostra
